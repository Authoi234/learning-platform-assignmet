                    <Accordion.Header>What is Cors?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                    CORS Resource Sharing in Node, Js is a mechanism by which a front-end client can make requests for resources to an external back-end server. The single-origin policy does not allow cross-origin requests and CORS headers are required to bypass this feature.

                    <Accordion.Header>Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                        I am using firebase because, this is one of the most easy and comfortable authentication system. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook , Apple, Github and Twitter, and more. This has many features. One of the my favourite feature is firebase hosting. That can deploy any site easily and quick. Firebase send Notifications to users, like reset-password requests, email verify requests and more. Firebase give you free storage.

                    <Accordion.Header>How does the private route work?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                    The private route component is similar to the public route, the only change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If the user is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login page and the user can only access the authenticated routes If he is authenticated.

                    <Accordion.Header>What is Node? How does Node work?</Accordion.Header>
                    <Accordion.Body>
                    Node is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user. HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind.
